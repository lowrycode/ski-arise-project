# SkiArise

SkiArise is a (fictitious) company specializing in package ski / snow-boarding holidays. The company wants a website to increase brand awareness and sales.

The [**project-planning document**](project_planning.md) outlines the business goals of the company and the user stories which were used to inform the development of the website.

## Contents

## User Experience Design
The following features contribute to a good User Experience (UX):

### 1. Simple Structure and Intuitive Navigation
The website categorises information in just 6 pages:
- **Homepage** - *includes key information about the company and their services*
- **All Packages page** - *lists all the package holidays offered (in alphabetical order)*
- **Info page** - *provides more information about their packages and ski package holidays in general*
- **Booking page** - *includes a form for booking a holiday with the company and leaving contact details for finalising details*
- **Enquiry page** - *includes a form for asking a question and leaving contact details (this feature is to encourage potential customers who are not yet ready to commit to buying a holiday to connect with the company)*
- **Success page** - *when a form is submitted, users are directed to this page to provide feedback that their form was submitted successfully*

Users can easily navigate to these pages through either the top navigation bar or through the contact section in the footer (which are both consistently shown on every page). 

There is also a link to the *About Us* section of the homepage from the top navigation bar.

In addition, there are sometimes links to specific sections of the *All Packages* and *Info* pages when it makes sense to link to these directly within the flow of the content.

### 2. Information Architecture

In addition to how the information is categorised on different pages, information is prioritised with the most important information appearing first.

For example:
- the ordering of items within the top navigation bar reflects the order in which users are likely to be looking for information
- the ordering of sections within the homepage (more details in a later section)
- the keys explaining what icons mean at the top of the all-packages page

### 3. Interaction Design (IXD)

The website follows standard conventions to make it predictable and easy for users to interact with.

For example:
- the navigation bar is positioned at the top of the screen on every page of the website and is consistently presented on all pages
- the hamburger icon is used for revealing and collapsing navigation items on smaller devices
- contact information is found at the bottom of each page and is consistently presented on all pages
- links to external social media platforms are found in the contact section and are presented using the standard icons used by these platforms
- Call To Action (CTA) buttons are positioned in the most obvious places (the top navigation bar and *Contact Us* footer section) and when applicable within the normal flow of content

The website also provides users with feedback when they hover over buttons (with colour changes) or clickable navigation cards (by enlarging), or when they submit a form (by presenting the user with a success message and a link to return to the homepage).

Content hinting is used (i.e. showing the start of the next section just above the fold) so that users know to scroll down for more content. A good example of this can be seen with the start of the popular package section appearing just underneath the hero image / video on the homepage.
