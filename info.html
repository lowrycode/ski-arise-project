                            <p>When choosing your holiday, look for a resort which has beginner-friendly slopes. Slopes
                                are
                                given a colour rating to indicate their level of difficulty. You should look out for the
                                green slopes.</p>
                            <p>You can find more information about slope categories <a href="info#slopes">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>Beginners don't need to invest in expensive equipment. You can rent skis, poles and

                                from the ski resort or a rental shop. </p>

                                holiday. We will sort all of these details for you before you go on your trip.</p>

                            <p>It is important to take the right clothing on a ski holiday.</p>
                            <p>Dress in layers: a moisture-wicking base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a waterproof
                                outer layer. Wear ski socks (not regular socks) to prevent blisters.</p>

                            <p>We highly recommend getting lessons from a professional ski instructor. Even a single
                                beginner lesson can significantly improve your experience.</p>
                            <p>All of the packages that we recommend for beginners have well respected ski schools at
                                the resort. For other packages, you can see if a ski school is available by looking at
                                the Resort Information provided with each package (on the All Packages page).</p>
                            <p>Since our customers have a range of abilities and requirements, we do not include ski

                                in the price of our packages (unless stated otherwise) so you will need to take this
